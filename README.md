## 缘起 Origin
### 从阅读中来 From Reading
在阅读的过程中，时常能碰到一些词，让人有醍醐灌顶之感
这些词的出现，这些词语的组合方式，甚至远比对这个词的一大段解释更有意义

On the journey of reading, I have encountered some words that give me huge inspiration
The appearance and the way words are composed of, is even more meaningful than long explanation for it.

### 高维度表达 High-dimensional expression
这大概算一种高维度表达
语言的表达能力本身是一维的，但却能表达高至无限维的思想
当我们听一些陈词滥调、八股文的时候，它所表达的信息就是无意义的，一维的
而当我们有“听君一席话，胜读十年书”之感时，它所表达的信息就是高维的，融合了很多需要用更多文字来解释，或者不管多少文字都表达不出来的丰富信息

This is the “high-dimensional expression”
The human language itself is one-dimensional, but it can express thoughts of up to infinite dimensions.
Sometimes we heard clichés or meaningless articles, the information expressed is nothing, or we can say in the form of "one-dimension".
Sometimes we heard somethings and got the feeling with a flash of inspiration, then the information expressed is "high-dimension", with rich information which can be explained by much more essays, or it can't be explained just by words

### 关于大师演讲 About Masters
所以同一个道理不同人讲，听者的感受会有显著区别，这种区别无法被简单的计算机程序识别
而一些大师虽然讲的仍然是众所周知的道理，但却明显不一样
原因就在于大师对事物的理解是透彻的，是高维的，所以他是可以兼容低维语言体系的
大师可以选择合适的的表达方式，选择合适的信息维度来表达，而这种高维度是可以被挺着捕获的
所以我们有3种状态，一个是鹦鹉学舌式的传递低维信息，二是自己有了高维的理解但无法表达，三是将一个看似低维的语句理解并表达为高维信息

When the same truth be told by different people, the listener's feelings will be significantly different. This difference cannot be recognized by simple computer programs.
That's why when Masters say well-known principles, those words are still ispirable.
The reason is that Master's understanding of things is thorough and high-dimensional, so when he speaks, he can be compatible with low-dimensional audience
Masters can choose the appropriate way of expression and the appropriate dimension of information to express, which can transfer the accurate information
So as a learner, we have three steps to go. Low-dimensional information processor, processors wiht high-dimensional understanding but unable to express, high information undertanding and express 

### 名词记录 Key Concepts
一些经典的名词，就是这种高维表达方式的浓缩
小时候总背古诗词和名人名言，还有一些成语，当时不理解，但经历世事后，可能会在某个时刻，脱口而出某个记忆深处的词语
一万个人心中可能有一万个哈姆雷特，但作者在创作内容的时候绝对是有很多个哈姆雷特的，甚至他不能用语言具体表达
这也是为什么圣经或者论语，诗歌或者音乐牛逼的原因，用一维的形式容纳超高维的信息，有无限兼容能力
所以当我们阅读时，有的书整本就表达一个意思，只需要记住那个词，以及看书时那本书给你的感觉，就可以了
比如“市场先生”“心流”“学会提问”“黑天鹅”
一个名词，用最简短的形式记录超高维的智慧
唯有智慧永恒

Some classic terms are the condensation of this high-dimensional expressions.
We were asked to memory many ancient poems, quotes from masters, and some idiomsmany when we were child. But the time we first get the feelings in these words are when we have experienced many things.
There may be 10,000 Hamlets in the minds of 10,000 readers, but the author definitely has many Hamlets in his mind when writing the book.
This can explain why the Bible or the Analects of Confucius, poetry or music are so awesome. The author used low-dimensional form to accommodate ultra-high-dimensional information and have unlimited compatibility.
So when we read, some books express one meaning as a whole. You just need to remember that words and the feeling that the book gives you when reading.
For example, "Mr. Market", "Flow", "Learn to Ask Questions" and "Black Swan"
A word that records ultra-high-dimensional wisdom in the shortest form
And only the wisdom is eternal.

## 足迹 Footprints
每个行业和领域都有自己的关键词列表
近几年我一般是在阅读书本、文章的时候收获一些
如果灵感乍现，那么赶紧记下来
目前收录了经济、投资、心理、社会等各方面的关键名词
足够形成一个小的知识宝库，信息维度密度都很高

Every industry and field has its own keyword list
In recent years, I have gained many key words during reading books and articles.
If inspiration strikes me, I mark it down quickly
I have collected many key comcepts in fields including economics, investment, psychology, society, etc.
These key concepts is enough to form a treasure house of knowledge, it's density and dimensions are very high.

## 展望 Outlook
理想中的人生是先有智慧、再靠智慧赚钱，过上自由的、有更多时间追求智慧的生活
价值投资界的各位大佬都是这样的，当然这是理想状态
未来就是保持阅读、保持思考、保持记录、保持提升

The ideal life in my thought is to gain wisdom firstly, then wisdom helps me making money, finally I can live a free life with more time to pursue wisdom.
All the big guys in the value investing field are living like this. Of course, this is an ideal state of me.
